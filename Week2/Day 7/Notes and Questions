What is The Viewport?
Answer: The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. 
        The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. 
        Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common 
        for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.
        
        <meta> tag is used to take control over the viewport.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
