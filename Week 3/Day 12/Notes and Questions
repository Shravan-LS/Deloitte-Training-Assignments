1. What is Clearfix class? Why do we use?
Answer: Clearfix class is used to automatically clear of fix its elements.
        Usually used in float layout. In CSS when two floated elements are stacked next to each other the parent container ends up with a height of 0,
        and it can easily wreak havoc on a layout.
        
        Bootstrap: Clearfix property clear all the floated content of the element that it is applied to.
        It is also used to clear floated content within a container. Example 2: With clearfix property,
        Without using the clearfix class, the parent div may not wrap around the children button elements
        properly and can cause a broken layout.
        
2. How to hide the elements using Bootstrap?
Answer: To hide elements simply use the .d-none class or one of the .d-{sm,md,lg,xl}-none classes for any responsive screen variation.
        
        To show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes you can combine one .d-*-none class with a .d-*-* class,
        for example .d-none .d-md-block .d-xl-none will hide the element for all screen sizes except on medium and large devices.
        
        Example: <div class="d-lg-none">hide on screens wider than lg</div>
                 <div class="d-none d-lg-block">hide on screens smaller than lg</div>
