            <p itemprop="receipe">Lobster is one of those seafoods that no one really cooks with often, but when you do, it makes any dinner beyond special. 
            Lobster rolls are perfect any way you make them. If you go the mayo route, try folding in a spoonful of Dijon, Old Bay seasoning, or swapping out the celery for pickled peppers. If you're a butter lover, swap in some slightly cooled browned butter before tossing with your lobster.
