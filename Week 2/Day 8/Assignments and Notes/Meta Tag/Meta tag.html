            <h2>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Movie</h2>
            <p>Revered on screen as Black Panther and much loved as a person and an actor, Chadwick Boseman’s death due to cancer in 2020 left a void in our hearts. The onset of a global pandemic at the time added to the emotional trauma and distress. Ryan Coogler’s second Black Panther movie draws that grief and brokenness from life and infuses it onto screen. The last Marvel film that was as emotionally charged and soul-stirring was perhaps Endgame. The sequel is a heart numbing, visually engrossing, spectacular blend of action and emotion. A special Marvel Studios logo dedicated to Chadwick sets the mood for the film, which is a poignant and spectacular tribute to the actor and the legacy of Black Panther.
