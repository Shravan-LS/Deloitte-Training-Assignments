1. Why do you use position property in CSS?
Answer: The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. 
        The top , right , bottom , and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.
        It specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.



2. What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative?
Answer: Position: Relative places an element relative to its current position without changing 
        the layout around it, whereas 
        
        Position: Absolute places an element relative to its parent's 
        position and changing the layout around it.
        
        Position property-----
        Absolute - The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
        Relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
