3. What are cookies on webpages?
Answer: Cookies are small pieces of information websites store on your computer. Cookies only contain bits of text, 
not anything else. The text can be a user ID, session ID, or any other text. For example, web pages can be 
configurable – a web page could have a Hide link that hides a certain element on the page. The page can save this 
setting on your computer with a cookie. When you load the page in the future, the page can examine the cookie and automatically hide the element.
If you clear your cookies, you’ll be logged out of all websites and websites won’t remember any settings you’ve changed on them.
