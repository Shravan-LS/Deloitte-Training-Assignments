            <p>Trekking in the Everest Region is some of the most beautiful in the world, and getting there is an adventure of its own. Nearly every trek begins with a flight from Kathmandu to the Tenzing-Hillary airport in Lukla, a small single landing strip airport high in the Himalayan mountains. It is the sole vehicle approach to the Everest Base Camp trek, and many others in the region. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.

            <p>Lukla rests at 9400 feet elevation (2,860 m), and its airport is a hub of trekking and shipping activity throughout the year. Nearly every trekker and piece of equipment comes through this airport, and it has received a steady increase in traffic over the years. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

            <br>
            <p>The flight from Kathmandu to Lukla is pretty short, often only 30 to 45 minutes (only 12 mins from Ramechhap). In that time you’ll see first hand why overland travel in Nepal can be so difficult as you pass over one isolated mountain valley after another, watching the terraced landscape of Nepal’s interconnected mountain ranges pass below you.</p>

            <h2>THE CAPTIVATING WILDLIFE OF NEPAL</h2>
            <img src="https://www.tourmyindia.com/treks/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/animals-himalayas-banner.jpg" alt="Wildlife">
            <p>Due to Nepal’s extreme geography, its biomes range from tropical to arctic with everything in between. This wild and biodiverse country has humid lowlands where one-horned rhinos and leopards meander and high cliffs where snow leopards and blue sheep leap from sheer face to sheer face. While on treks in Nepal it’s possible to see stunning animals found nowhere else in the world, such as red pandas and Himalayan butterflies. In the country’s national parks you can see rare river dolphins, bizarre looking crocodiles, and take jungle safaris to scout out tigers and leopards. Explore with us in this blog post some of Nepal’s most fantastic wildlife!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Easily recognizable by their tear marked face, red pandas are easily one of Nepal’s most beautiful residents.  Only found in the Eastern Himalayan Range, these unique animals spend most of their time in the treetops where they eat forest fruits, vegetables, grasses, and other vegetation.  Walking the foothills of Nepal looking for this elusive and endangered animal is an experience like no other.  This endangered species can be found in 5 distinct districts of Nepal and in the following parks: Langtang National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Sagarmatha National Park, Manaslu Conservation Area, Makalu Barun National Park and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Like most deer, musk deer are shy herbivores that eat leaves, grasses and flowers. What makes them a very interesting animal is that the males have large sabre-like fangs that they use to fight other males for the females.   They also produce a musk scent that is highly sought after for traditional Chinese medicine and for making perfumes (due to the belief that it is an aphrodisiac). Due to their nocturnal nature these endangered deer are not easily spotted but they do live in Mustang and Manang, near the Annapurna Himalayas of Nepal.</p>
