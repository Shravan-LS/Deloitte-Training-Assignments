1. What is useRef()? Why do we use it?
Answer: 

useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current . When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0) . It's like doing this: const count = {current: 0} . We can access the count by using count.current.

The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
