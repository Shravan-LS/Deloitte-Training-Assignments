1. What is BOM?    Diff... between DOM and BOM?
Answer: BOM is a Browser Object Model, which is a window object supported by all browsers representing a browser window 
        consisting of navigator, history, screen, location and document objects which are children of windows. 
        BOM can function to check an event from windows with window.addEventListener and can perform manipulation 
        using window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth.

        The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, the HTML elements themselves, 
        e.g. document and all traversal you would do in it, events, etc.
        The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document, 
        like history, location, navigator and screen (as well as some others that vary by browser).
        
 2. What is event target property in javascript?
Answer: The target event property returns the element that triggered the event. The target property gets the element
        on which the event originally occurred, opposed to the currentTarget property, which always refers to the element whose
        event listener triggered the event.
