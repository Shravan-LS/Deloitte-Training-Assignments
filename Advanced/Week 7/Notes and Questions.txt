2. How to use *ngIf in Angular?
Answer: A shorthand form of the directive, *ngIf="condition", is generally used, provided as an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted template.
        Angular expands this into a more explicit version, in which the anchor element is contained in an <ng-template> element.
        
        Ex:  <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>

3. How to hide a html element using Angular ?
Answer: The ng-hide directive hides the HTML element if the expression evaluates to true.
        ng-hide is also a predefined CSS class in AngularJS, and sets the element's display to none.
        
        Ex:  Hide HTML: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="myVar">
            <div ng-hide="myVar">
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my home.</p>
            </div>
