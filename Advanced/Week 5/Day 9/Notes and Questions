1. What is eval() method in JavaScript? How to use it? Check with an example?
Answer:  The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.
         If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. 
         If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements. 
         
        let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        let text = "x * y";
        let result = eval(text);
        
        Do NOT use eval()
        Executing JavaScript from a string is an BIG security risk.
        With eval(), malicious code can run inside your application without permission.
        With eval(), third-party code can see the scope of your application, which can lead to possible attacks.
