1. What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript? What are asynchronous functions?
Answer.   i) setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.
         ii) setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

          Example: 
          function sayHi() {
            alert('Hello');
          }

          setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);
          setInterval(sayHi, 1000);

2. What is Asynchronous?
Answer: The word asynchronous means not occurring at the same time.
        Asynchronous JavaScript simply implies the fact that the code will not execute synchronously, it can run at any time predefined by the programmer.
        
        Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other
        events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.
        Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously.
